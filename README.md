# Todolist app

Simple to-do list Angular web app that allows you to create and delete items from a list.

This is just the front-end side of the app, and it relies on your local storage to save the to-do list.

## What I used

- [Angular 10](https://angular.io/)
- [Bulma 0.9.1](https://bulma.io/)
- [Font Awesome 5](https://fontawesome.com/)
- [angular-cli-ghpages 0.6.2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular-cli-ghpages)

## Try it!

A live version of the app is hosted in this repo's [GitHub Page](https://daiboruta.github.io/todolist/)
